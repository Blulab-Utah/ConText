JavaConText 
-----------
JavaConText is a Java implementation of the ConText algorithm.

References of the ConText algorithm:
- Chapman WW, Dowling JN, Chu DL. ConText: An algorithm for identifying contextual features from clinical text. In: BioNLP Workshop of the Association for Computational Linguistics Prague, Czech Republic; 2007. p. 81-88.
- Harkema H, Thornblade T, Dowling J, Chapman WW. Portability of ConText: An Algorithm for determining Negation, Experiencer, and Temporal Status from Clinical Reports. J Biomed Inform. 2009;42(5):839-851.

JavaConText comes with a runnable Jar file, which implements a GUI for using and testing the ConText algorithm.
JavaContext recognizes the local features of negation, temporality and experiencer, at sentence level. The concepts have to be specified as an input parameters of the algorithm.
